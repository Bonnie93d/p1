            	<h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> My name is Bonnie Dowling, in 2002 I received my associates degree in visual communications (web/graphic art), yet then began working in a job that hardly utilized my skills. After not keeping up with the field for years I decided to go back to school and began classes at the extension school.  Over the last few years I have taken classes on Java, HTML 5, CSS, and Flash.  I am very excited to be taking this class; I always have ideas for creating dynamic sites, yet don't know where/how to start.  I try to hide it but at heart I am just a big geek.... Yet I do have some other hobbies that don't involve the computer, for example I enjoy arts/crafts, sewing, baking, painting, etc.  Basically, I am a creative person who loves to create things online and off.

            	<p>For a code editor I use TextMate and sometimes Dreamweaver</p>
